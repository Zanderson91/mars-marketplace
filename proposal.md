# Idea..

Creating an e-commerce platform for the future!
Mars Marketplace is a platform that allows users to view and add items to an e-commerce site intended for those living on another planet.

* As a user, I want to be able to create an account and login with my credentials.

* As a user, I want to be able to create a new product listing.

* As a user, I want to be able to view all available products.

* As a user, I want to be able to view singular products by id.

*As a user, I want to be able to delete a posting, if an item becomes unavailable.
